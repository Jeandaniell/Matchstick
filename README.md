# Matchstick

<p>Compilation: ./matchstick n1 n2 </p> <p>(n1: first parameter representing the number of lines 
and n2: second parameter representing the maximum number of matches that can be removed) </p>

<p>The goal of the project is to create a program that you can play against.
The basic version must generate a game board with n matchstick lines (1 < n < 100) and have a simple interface so that the user could play against the computer.</p>

<pThe number of lines is given as parameter to the program.
The second parameter of the program indicates the maximum number of matches that can be taken out
each turn (must be > 0). </p>
<p>When matchsticks are removed, they must be removed starting from the right (like in the example below).
The user will always start the game.
The program’s output (error messages included) must correspond to the examples below. Error messages
which happens during a game and which are destined to the player must be displayed on the standard
output. </p>

<p>In case of bad input, you must ask for the line by displaying “Line: ” again, and it’s up to the player to indicate
again the line he/she wants to play on.</p>
